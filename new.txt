DevOps: A Beginner's Guide

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).
It aims to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high quality.

Key Concepts:

1. Continuous Integration (CI)
    - Automatically test code changes as they're committed
    - Catch bugs early in the development process

2. Continuous Deployment (CD)
    - Automatically deploy tested code to production environments
    - Reduce manual deployment errors

3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
    - Manage infrastructure using code instead of manual processes
    - Makes environments reproducible and scalable

4. Automation
    - Automate repetitive tasks (testing, building, deploying)
    - Free up time for more important work

5. Monitoring & Logging
    - Track application and system performance
    - Quickly identify and fix issues

Core Benefits:
- Faster software releases
- Improved collaboration between teams
- Better code quality
- Reduced deployment failures
- Quicker incident response

Popular DevOps Tools:
- Git (version control)
- Jenkins (CI/CD)
- Docker (containerization)
- Kubernetes (orchestration)
- Ansible (automation)
